/**
 * HEXAGONAL COORDINATE SYSTEM (AXIAL)
 *
 * We use 'q' and 'r' to represent our hex grid, which is essentially
 * a skewed square grid. This is standard for hexagonal math.
 *
 * - q (Column): The horizontal axis. q=-5 is file 'a', q=+5 is file 'l'.
 * - r (Row): The diagonal axis (60° from q).
 *
 * MATH CONSTANT:
 * In a hex grid, there is an implicit third coordinate 's' where:
 * q + r + s = 0. We only store q and r because s = -q - r.
 *
 * COORDINATE DIRECTIONS:
 * - Orthogonal (Rook-like): Move through a shared edge (+q, +r, or +s).
 * - Diagonal (Bishop-like): Move through a shared vertex (two coords change).
