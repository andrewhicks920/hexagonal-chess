# Hexagonal Chess

A fully playable implementation of [**Glinski's hexagonal chess**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_chess#Gli%C5%84ski). 
Built with React, TypeScript, and SVG rendering.

## About

Glinski's hexagonal chess is a two-player chess variant invented by Władysław Gliński in 1936. The game is played on a 
hexagonal board with 91 cells arranged in an 11-file, three-color layout. All standard chess pieces are present, with 
movement rules adapted to the hexagonal geometry.

## Features

- Full implementation of Glinski's rules including:
  - All six piece types with hex-adapted movement
  - Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection
  - En passant captures
  - Pawn promotion with piece-selection dialog
  - Stalemate scoring (¾ point to the delivering player per Glinski's rules)
- SVG-rendered board with 14 built-in color themes
- Visual move highlighting — legal moves shown on piece selection
- Game status bar — turn indicator, check warnings, and game-over messages
- Captured pieces display
- Reset button to start a new game

## Implementation Notes

The board uses **axial coordinates** `(q, r)` where cells satisfy `max(|q|, |r|, |q+r|) ≤ 5`, producing exactly 91 valid cells. 
Cell colors are assigned using `(q - r) mod 3`, guaranteeing bishops always remain on the same color.

Move generation produces pseudo-legal moves that are then filtered to remove any that leave the king in check.
